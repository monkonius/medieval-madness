You were on your way home one night from the nearby convenience store when a deep fog suddenly envelops around you. Confused, you slowly try to make your way through. As you wave your arms aimlessly in front of you, a rather peculiar stone-like surface appears while the fog begins to dissipate.
With the fog cleared, you then realize you're in a totally unfamiliar setting: a medieval castle! Surrounded by knights and maidens, no less! You've been transported to the middle ages! Find your way back home!
